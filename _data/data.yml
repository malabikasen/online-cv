career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I started my career in the industry as a Software Engineer at JP Morgan Chase & Co. after graduating from the University of Mumbai in 2017.
      Most of my learnings about project planning, estimation, good coding practices and testing come from my time there. One of the things which I enjoyed the most was
      debugging and finding bugs in production code which often got missed during testing in development.
      
      
      I am a firm believer that Software Engineering is more than combining pieces of code together - it goes much beyond that. Designing a good software can often prevent
      future problems. 
      
      
      Software Engineering is like problem-solving for me with a sight on a multitude of things like usability, efficiency, security
      and being smart with the appropriate tools to list a few.
      
      
      Currently I am in my final semester of my Masters from Virginia Tech. Set to graduate in the summer of 2021, 
      I am open to Full-Time Software Development Engineering opportunities. 
      Please feel free to reach out to me at [malabika at vt DOT edu](mailto:malabika@vt.edu) if you have any questions!
